Ji Woong ("Ji") Park is a 4th year Molecular Cell Biology (DBBS) PhD graduate student in Peterson Lab. Ji graduated from Washington & Jefferson College with B.A. in Chemistry with Honors and minor in Neuroscience. His previous research experiences span cardiovascular molecular biology (Cincinnati College of Medicine), biophysical instrumentation (W&J), and protein biochemistry in axon degeneration (Wash U Med). Ji is leading MORPHEOME - Molecular ORPHan PhEnOtype MatchEr project and involved in establishing computational pipeline combined with wet-lab validation to elucidate novel genes in osteoporosis and depression. He is passionate about coding and is involved with LaunchCode in STL. In his spare time, he is an avid foodie (with photos to prove) and has been to 5 ramen restaurants in STL (Robata, Nami, Midtown, Death in the Afternoon, and Vista).

Damon is a recent graduate of William Woods University in Fulton, MO where he majored in Biology with minors in Physics and Chemistry. His previous work includes research in clinical imaging to improve malignant tumor treatment in adaptive radiotherapy. His work specifically allows radiotherapy to be administered more accurately leading to decreased adverse effects and cancer recurrence and improved outcomes and improved quality of life for cancer patients. Damon plans to attend medical school and pursue a career in a surgical specialty and research such as orthopedic or neurosurgery. </div> </div>

**Sandeep Kumar, PhD** - 

Sandeep is a Senior Scientist in the lab leading the *10X healthspan/lifespan project*.

<hr>

**Cheng Lyu** - 

Cheng is a Biostatistics Master's student who is working on *Disruptive Innovation of Blockbuster drugs* using CRISPRi screening. Specifically, he is doing statistical analysis to determine whether the genes we identify in screening with clinical drugs using CRISPRi are also variant in people with altered drug responses to the drugs.
