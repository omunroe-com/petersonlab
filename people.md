I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at Washington University St. Louis. I study genomics, metabolomics and the quantified self of aging and mental health. Currently, my group is working on an osteoporosis project.

**<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/damon-burrow-947126127"> Damon Burrow</a>** is a new addition to the Tim Peterson Lab here at Washington University. Damon is a recent graduate of William Woods University in Fulton, MO where he majored in Biology with minors in Physics and Chemistry. His previous work includes research in clinical imaging to improve malignant tumor treatment in adaptive radiotherapy. His work specifically allows radiotherapy to be administered more accurately leading to decreased adverse effects and cancer recurrence and improved outcomes and improved quality of life for cancer patients. Damon plans to attend medical school and pursue a career in a surgical specialty and research such as orthopedic or neurosurgery.

**Niki Song** - 

Niki joined the lab in October 2016, where she will be performing CRISPRi screenings to identify novel targets for clinical depression drugs and working on the burgeoning connection between depression and bone loss. She graduated from Washington University in 2016 with a major in Psychology. Niki is planning to attend medical school next fall and is interested in potentially pursuing the field of psychiatry.

When sheâ€™s not in lab, you can find Niki curled up under her blankets at home binge-watching Stranger Things, The Walking Dead, or MasterChef. She likes to stay active through dancing and weightlifting. Niki is also a dedicated foodie and loves exploring restaurants around St. Louis.
